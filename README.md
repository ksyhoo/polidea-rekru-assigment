### `TODO`

Application is written in simple and naive. Based on project size / complexity / timeframes I would implement or use:

1. Component compositon / HOC
2. Redux-saga
3. Infinite Scroll - finish
4. Tests
5. Normalize response, store data in objects, use library like `https://github.com/paularmstrong/normalizr`
6. check if item in state already on details page
